            You were anointed as a guardian cherub,

            you walked among the fiery stones.
            You were blameless in your ways
            from the day you were created

              and like a root out of dry ground.

              nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.
              He was despised and rejected by mankind,
              a man of suffering, and familiar with pain.
              Like one from whom people hide their faces
              he was despised, and we held him in low esteem.
              Surely he took up our pain
              and bore our suffering,
              yet we considered him punished by God,
              stricken by him, and afflicted.
              But he was pierced for our transgressions,
              he was crushed for our iniquities;
              the punishment that brought us peace was on him,
              and by his wounds we are healed.
              We all, like sheep, have gone astray,
              each of us has turned to our own way;
              and the Lord has laid on him
              the iniquity of us all.
              He was oppressed and afflicted,
              yet he did not open his mouth;
              he was led like a lamb to the slaughter,
              and as a sheep before its shearers is silent,
              so he did not open his mouth.<br>
