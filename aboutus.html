          At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of
          heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and
          prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. (Matthew 11:25)

        <div class="col-lg-10 mx-auto">
          <h2 class="display-6">
            We are a small group of people doing bible study, research and
            supporting each other, grow in faith, and carry out God's work
            together. Verse below shows the significance of fellowship,
            encouragement, accountability, and love within small groups of
            believers.
          </h2>

      <div class="container py-5">
        <div class="calloutblue">
          <h3 class="fw-bold">Acts 2:42</h3>
          <h4>
            “They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to
            fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.”
          </h4>
        </div>
        <h3 class="fw-light">
          Verse above also describes how people followed Jesus's desciples.
          Small groups have a very important role in being a guide to others, in
          a confused and sensless world. We ought to teach or guide learners
          simple things in Christianity. Like the breaking of bread at His last
          supper. Washing of the feet. Greeting one another in Jesus's name,
          etc.
        </h3>
        <div class="calloutgreen">
          <h3 class="fw-bold">Hebrews 10:24-25</h3>
          <h4>
            “And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and
            good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit
            of doing, but encouraging one another-and all the more as you see
            the Day approaching.”
          </h4>
        </div>
        <h3 class="fw-light">
          This verse strongly emphasis the need to encourage and meet one
          another on a daily basis. But some members may see it as monotonus or
          unnecessary or may be having other committments and may not be able to
          meet regularly. Yes, now a days with job and family life, it may not
          be possible. But we can try and God can see how hard we are trying.
        </h3>
        <div class="calloutgrey">
          <h3 class="fw-bold">1 Peter 5:8</h3>
          <h4>
            Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about
            like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.
          </h4>
        </div>
        <h3 class="fw-light">
          This is the reason why out group meets often in the name of Jesus
          because the children of devil are waiting to pounce on you, to take
          you into distraction and deveate you mind from Christ. There are only
          a few Christians left and it's going to be difficult to stay away from
          sin.
        </h3>
        <div class="calloutcyan">
          <h3 class="fw-bold">1 Corinthians 10:13</h3>
          <h4>
            No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but
            God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what
            you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of
            escape, that you may be able to bear it.
          </h4>
        </div>
        <h3 class="fw-light">
          It is hard to find the truth in this world, now a days and it's only
          going to get worse. That's why we need God's hand even more, in times
          like this. So have God first in everything you do and He will make a
          way to excape as He has promised in the verse above. Keep in mind the
          verse below and you will have something to look forward, in times of
          darkness.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="fw-light">
          Verse below is one of the last letter's written by Peter giving us an
          insight to the future.
        </h3>
        <div class="calloutred">
          <h3 class="fw-bold">2 Peter 3:11-13</h3>
          <h4>
            Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people
            ought you to be? You ought to conduct yourselves in holiness and
            godliness as you anticipate and hasten the coming of the day of God,
            when the heavens will be destroyed by fire and the elements will
            melt in the heat. But in keeping with God's promise, we are looking
            forward to a new heaven and a new earth, where righteousness dwells.
